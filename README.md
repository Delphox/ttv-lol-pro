This is a fork of the original project at https://github.com/TTV-LOL/extensions
```

>

[TTV LOL](https://ttv.lol/) removes livestream ads from [twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/)

This fork:

- disables TTV LOL for channels you are subscribed to,
- lets you whitelist channels for which you would like TTV LOL to be disabled,
- improves your privacy by letting you remove the token parameter from API requests,
- improves streaming reliability by falling back to the stream with ads if the API errors out,
- lets you use a local server to enable additional features (not recommended).

In addition, use [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) to:

- remove banner ads,
- block ads on VODs.

Use [TTV LOL extended](https://github.com/younesaassila/ttv-lol-extended) to:

- watch sub-only VODs.
